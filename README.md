## Prerequisites

cmux-hub connects to the cmux Unix socket (`/tmp/cmux.sock`). The default socket mode only allows cmux child processes to connect.

If you launch cmux-hub from within cmux (e.g. Claude Code commands, terminal shell), the default mode works. If you launch from an external process (Alfred, Raycast, Karabiner Elements, etc.), set **Automation mode**:

> cmux Settings → Automation → Socket Control Mode → **Automation mode**

Or set `CMUX_SOCKET_MODE=allowAll`.

## Install

Download binary from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/azu/cmux-hub/releases/latest):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
curl -fsSL "https://github.com/azu/cmux-hub/releases/latest/download/cmux-hub-darwin-arm64" -o ~/.local/bin/cmux-hub
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/cmux-hub
```

## Update

```bash
cmux-hub update
```

## Usage

```bash
# Run (diff of current directory)
cmux-hub

# Specify target directory
cmux-hub /home/user/project

# Custom toolbar actions
cmux-hub --actions actions.json

# Read actions from stdin
cat actions.json | cmux-hub --actions -
```

### Usage with cmux + Claude Code

When launched inside cmux, cmux-hub automatically opens a browser split pane and shuts down when the pane closes.

#### Plugin (recommended)

Install as a Claude Code plugin. This auto-installs the binary, sets up SessionStart hooks, and copies default actions to `~/.claude/cmux-hub.json`. Project-local `.claude/cmux-hub.json` takes priority if present.

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add azu/cmux-hub
claude plugin install cmux-hub@cmux-hub-marketplace
```

The first session start downloads the binary, so it may take a few seconds to launch.

Update the plugin:

```bash
claude plugin update cmux-hub@cmux-hub-marketplace
```

#### Manual setup

`.claude/cmux-hub.json`:

```json
[
  { "label": "Commit", "type": "paste-and-enter", "command": "commit this change" },
  { "label": "Create PR", "type": "paste-and-enter", "command": "create a pull request" }
]
```

`.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "cmux-hub --actions .claude/cmux-hub.json"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Options

```
-p, --port <port>      Server port (default: random)
-a, --actions <file>   Toolbar actions JSON file (use - for stdin)
--dry-run              Don't connect to cmux socket
--debug                Enable debug logging (also: DEBUG=*)
-v, --version          Show version
-h, --help             Show help
```

## Diff Behavior

### Auto-diff

The `/api/diff/auto` endpoint computes the appropriate diff range based on the current branch.

| Situation                    | Diff range                        | Includes untracked |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Feature branch               | merge-base to HEAD + working tree | No                 |
| Default branch (main/master) | HEAD vs working tree              | Yes                |
| No commits yet               | Staged changes                    | Yes                |

### Commit History

When no pending changes are detected, the UI shows recent commits. Clicking a commit displays its diff. A "Commits" link in the toolbar opens the commit list at any time.

## Custom Actions

Pass a JSON file via `--actions` to customize toolbar buttons. The `type` field is required.

### Action Definition

```json
[
  {
    "label": "Commit",
    "type": "paste-and-enter",
    "command": "/commit"
  },
  {
    "label": "Create PR",
    "type": "shell",
    "command": "gh pr create --title \"$TITLE\"",
    "input": { "placeholder": "PR title...", "variable": "TITLE" }
  },
  {
    "label": "More",
    "submenu": [{ "label": "Stash", "type": "shell", "command": "git stash" }]
  }
]
```

### Action Fields

| Field     | Type                                      | Description                          |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `label`   | `string`                                  | Button label                         |
| `command` | `string`                                  | Command to execute                   |
| `type`    | `"paste-and-enter" \| "shell" \| "paste"` | Execution mode (required)            |
| `input`   | `{ placeholder, variable }`               | Shows an input form before executing |
| `submenu` | `ActionItem[]`                            | Nested menu (instead of `command`)   |

### Execution Modes

| type                | Behavior                                                             | Use case                                             |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `"shell"`           | Executes as a subshell on the server. Returns stdout/stderr/exitCode | `git commit`, `gh pr create`                         |
| `"paste-and-enter"` | Pastes text to cmux terminal and sends Enter                         | Commands for Claude Code or other terminal processes |
| `"paste"`           | Pastes text to cmux terminal without Enter                           | Paste text only                                      |

### Variables

Commands can reference shell variables. Variables are prepended as inline environment variables (env prefix).

#### Built-in Variables (shell type only)

| Variable               | Description                      | Example              |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `$CMUX_HUB_CWD`        | Target directory (absolute path) | `/home/user/project` |
| `$CMUX_HUB_GIT_BRANCH` | Current git branch               | `feat/new-feature`   |
| `$CMUX_HUB_GIT_BASE`   | Diff base branch (auto-detected) | `main`               |
| `$CMUX_HUB_PORT`       | Server port                      | `4567`               |
| `$CMUX_HUB_SURFACE_ID` | cmux terminal surface ID         | `surface:123`        |

#### User Input Variables

Variables defined in `input.variable` are set as environment variables from user input.

```json
{ "command": "git commit -m \"$MSG\"", "input": { "variable": "MSG" } }
```

#### Safety

Variable values are single-quote escaped and prepended as env prefix. The `/api/action` endpoint only accepts an action ID and user input variables — not raw command strings. Variable keys are validated against `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*`.

## GitHub Integration

When the current branch has an associated Pull Request, cmux-hub polls GitHub via `gh` CLI and displays:

- CI check statuses (success, failure, in-progress)
- PR review comments with file path and line number
- PR info (title, state, base/head branch)

PR data is pushed to the frontend via WebSocket every 10 seconds.

## Development

```bash
bun install

# HMR with hot reload
bun --hot src/cli.ts

# With custom actions
bun --hot src/cli.ts --actions - <<'EOF'
[
  { "label": "Commit", "type": "paste-and-enter", "command": "commit this change" },
  { "label": "Push", "type": "shell", "command": "git push" }
]
EOF

# Build standalone binary
bun run build:compile
```

On macOS, `cp` strips the binary's adhoc codesignature and the OS will SIGKILL it on launch. After installing a locally-built binary, re-sign it:

```bash
cp cmux-hub ~/.local/bin/cmux-hub
codesign --force --sign - ~/.local/bin/cmux-hub
```

When running a local build (without installing via the plugin marketplace), the plugin's skills are not auto-discovered by Claude Code. To make the `start` skill available — so Claude can re-launch cmux-hub if you close the browser pane during a session — copy it into `~/.claude/skills/`, substituting `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` with the absolute path to the local `cmux-hub-plugin` directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/cmux-hub-start
sed "s|\${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}|$(pwd)/cmux-hub-plugin|g" \
  cmux-hub-plugin/skills/start/SKILL.md \
  > ~/.claude/skills/cmux-hub-start/SKILL.md
```

Re-run that one-liner if the upstream `SKILL.md` changes. None of this is necessary when installing via `claude plugin install cmux-hub@cmux-hub-marketplace` — the plugin runtime handles binary install, hook registration, skill discovery, and `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` resolution.

The `start` skill calls `ensure-cmux-hub.sh`, which compares the current binary version against `cmux-hub-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and downloads a matching release from GitHub if they differ. As long as you keep `plugin.json`'s version in sync with your locally-built binary, this is a no-op. If you bump the version locally to test an unreleased build, the download will 404 and the skill will fail — either revert the version bump or remove the `ensure-cmux-hub.sh` invocation from your local copy of the skill.

To undo a local-build install before switching to the plugin marketplace install:

```bash
# Remove the locally-built binary (plugin will manage its own copy)
rm -f ~/.local/bin/cmux-hub

# Remove the copied skill
rm -rf ~/.claude/skills/cmux-hub-start

# Remove the SessionStart entry pointing at this fork's start.sh from
# ~/.claude/settings.json (edit by hand, or use `jq`)
```

```bash
bun test          # Run tests
bun run lint      # Lint
bun run fmt       # Format
bun run typecheck # Type check
bun run test:e2e  # E2E tests
```
